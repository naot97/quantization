# Script to run lm-evaluation-harness against a running vLLM OpenAI-compatible server.
#
# Usage:
#   bash run_lm_eval_vllm.sh <model_name> [port] [task]
#
# Arguments:
#   <model_name>: The name of the model being served (e.g., Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B). Used for the 'model' argument in lm_eval.
#   [port]:       The port the vLLM server is listening on (default: 8000).
#   [task]:       The lm_eval task(s) to run (default: mmlu).
#
# Example:
#   # Start vLLM server first (in another terminal):
#   # vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 4
#
#   # Then run this script for MMLU (default task):
#   bash run_lm_eval_vllm.sh Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B 8000
#
#   # Run for a different task, e.g., hellaswag:
#   bash run_lm_eval_vllm.sh Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B 8000 hellaswag
